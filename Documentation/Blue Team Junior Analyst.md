# Introduction to Digital Forensics

* Computer Forensics – Identifying, collecting, and preserving evidence taken from desktops, laptops, and other computer systems and storage media to aid investigations or legal proceedings.
* Network Forensics – The monitoring, collection, and analysis of network activities such as visited websites and connected IPs, usually associated with incident response and intrusion detection.
* Memory Forensics – The process of recovering evidence from the RAM of a running system (also known as live acquisition or live response).
* Mobile Forensics – The process of recovering evidence from mobile phones, SIM cards, PDAs, tablets, and other mobile devices.


| Incident Response Capabilities | Legal Prosecution and Chain of Custody | Monitoring Employees |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| To improve **incident response capabilities**, it's important to have a team with strong technical backgrounds. When dealing with an incident, it is crucial to **correctly gather and preserve evidence**. **Digital Forensics analysts** are a great asset for investigating malicious activities like malware infections or insider threats. | A key procedure for submitting digital evidence in court is the **Chain of Custody**. If evidence is not kept secure and unmodified, it will be invalid and hold no weight in court. Forensics experts know how to handle and secure evidence to maintain its integrity. | Sometimes it's necessary to **closely monitor employees** due to suspicious or malicious behavior, such as inappropriate internet browsing or downloading malicious files. Forensics analysts can monitor for insider threats and covertly collect evidence for Human Resources or law enforcement. |


| Role | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 SOC Analyst** | Conducts initial investigations and first-line incident response. Collects evidence like IPs, domains, and emails to justify defensive actions. |
| **Tier 2/3 SOC Analyst** | Handles escalated and more critical investigations requiring greater technical expertise and access to specialized tools. Evidence collection is under stricter conditions. |
| **Malware Analyst** | Uses digital forensics to analyze malware samples, discover their purpose, and gather Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for future detection. |
| **Digital Forensics Analyst** | Works on high-profile investigations, escalated cases, and employee monitoring. Collaborates with the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) on tasks requiring trusted, highly-technical individuals. |
| **Insider Threat Analyst** | Utilizes extensive digital forensics skills to detect and monitor insider threats, ensuring all evidence against an individual is collected appropriately. |
| **Threat Hunter** | Expert technical defender with a deep understanding of offensive and defensive practices. Hunts for threats by understanding computer/network workings and identifying key artifacts. |
| **Incident Responder** | Top-tier security analyst with skills across blue-team disciplines, including forensics. Conducts deep, in-depth investigations to understand how a system was compromised and the behavior of the device. Often works with Forensic Examiners to retrieve and analyze data from physical media. |


### Evidence Collection

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **KAPE** | **K**roll **A**rtifact **P**arser and **E**xtractor is a free, open-source tool for automating the collection and parsing of forensic artifacts from a computer's file system and memory. It can be used locally or remotely to quickly gather key data. |
| **FTK Imager** | A tool for creating hard drive and memory images for analysis. It can also import disk images, allowing users to navigate the file system as if on a live device. |
| **EnCase** | A suite of tools for digital forensics and e-Discovery. It can take forensic images of computers, mobile phones, and IoT devices for evidence collection and analysis. |
| **Cellebrite** | A suite of tools designed for mobile forensics, enabling the acquisition and processing of data from mobile devices. |

### Evidence Analysis

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autopsy** | An open-source digital forensics tool with a user-friendly interface. It analyzes forensic images from hard drives and mobile devices to extract key information like recently used programs, deleted files, emails, and visited websites. |
| **Volatility** | A Python-based memory forensics framework that analyzes memory dumps to uncover a computer's past activities and potential malicious actions. It works across Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and can even recover deleted files. |
