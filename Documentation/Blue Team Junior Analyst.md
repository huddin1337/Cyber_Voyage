# Introduction to Digital Forensics

* Computer Forensics – Identifying, collecting, and preserving evidence taken from desktops, laptops, and other computer systems and storage media to aid investigations or legal proceedings.
* Network Forensics – The monitoring, collection, and analysis of network activities such as visited websites and connected IPs, usually associated with incident response and intrusion detection.
* Memory Forensics – The process of recovering evidence from the RAM of a running system (also known as live acquisition or live response).
* Mobile Forensics – The process of recovering evidence from mobile phones, SIM cards, PDAs, tablets, and other mobile devices.


### Supporting Incident Response Capabilities

To improve **incident response capabilities**, it's important to have a team with strong technical backgrounds and skills. This is especially true for responding to escalated security events.

When dealing with a security incident, it is crucial to **correctly gather and preserve evidence**. This evidence is vital for analysis, intelligence sharing, and potential legal prosecution. **Digital Forensics analysts** are a great asset, using their deep technical knowledge and analysis techniques to investigate malicious activities like malware infections or insider threats.


### Legal Prosecution and Chain of Custody

A key procedure for submitting digital evidence in court is the **Chain of Custody**. If evidence is not kept secure, accounted for, and unmodified, it will be invalid and hold no weight in court. Forensics experts are familiar with how to appropriately handle and secure evidence to maintain its integrity.


### Monitoring Employees

Sometimes it's necessary to **closely monitor employees** due to suspicious or malicious behavior. This can include:
* Inappropriate internet browsing on company systems
* Breaches of an Acceptable Use Policy
* Downloading malicious or inappropriate files

Forensics analysts are trained to monitor for insider threats and covertly collect evidence. This evidence can then be used by the Human Resources department to justify termination or be handed over to law enforcement if laws have been broken.
