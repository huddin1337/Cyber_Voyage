* Yara (Loki) : YARA is great for creating and running rules to detect malware patterns by matching strings, byte sequences, or behaviors in files. LOKI is a lightweight scanner that uses YARA rules (plus hash and regex checks) to quickly hunt for indicators of compromise (IOCs) on a system. Together, theyâ€™re effective for threat hunting, malware detection, and incident response with minimal setup.
* n8n : n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect different apps, APIs, and services to automate tasks without heavy coding. It works like a self-hosted alternative to Zapier, giving you full control, flexibility, and privacy over your automations. You can build workflows visually, integrating anything from cloud apps to custom scripts.
