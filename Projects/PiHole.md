I will be installing Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to act as a network-wide ad blocker and DNS sinkhole. I’ll walk through the setup process step by step, starting with preparing the Pi (flashing Raspberry Pi OS, connecting it to the network, and updating packages), then moving on to installing Pi-hole using the automated installer. After that, I’ll configure the Pi-hole admin interface, set the Pi as my network’s DNS server, and test it to make sure it’s blocking ads properly. This summary will outline the exact steps I took to get Pi-hole up and running on my Pi Zero 2 W.
