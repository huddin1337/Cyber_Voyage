# ðŸ”’ Cybersecurity Homelab Roadmap

## Phase 1: Base Infrastructure
- [ ] Install Proxmox VE
- [ ] Create pfSense VM  
  - Configure firewall rules  
  - Setup DHCP & VLANs for network segmentation  
  - Enable VPN access (OpenVPN/WireGuard)  

## Phase 2: Network Defense
- [ ] Deploy IDS/IPS  
  - Option A: Suricata standalone  
  - Option B: Security Onion (lightweight mode)  
- [ ] Connect IDS/IPS to pfSense for inline/alerting  

## Phase 3: Monitoring & SIEM
- [ ] Install Wazuh or ELK stack  
  - Collect logs from pfSense + IDS/IPS  
  - Configure dashboards for threat monitoring  
- [ ] Tune rules for alert reduction  

## Phase 4: Offensive Lab (Main Computer - VirtualBox)
- [ ] Deploy Kali Linux VM (attacker machine)  
- [ ] Deploy Metasploitable VM (target machine)  
- [ ] Deploy Nessus VM (vulnerability scanning)  
- [ ] Run scans against Metasploitable  
- [ ] Document findings & remediation steps
- [ ] Run & Configure LAMP Stack  

## Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] Forward logs from Kali, Metasploitable, and Nessus to Wazuh/ELK  
- [ ] Visualize attacks and alerts in dashboards  
- [ ] Build detection rules for simulated attacks  

## Phase 6: Advanced Scenarios
- [ ] Red Team vs Blue Team exercise  
  - Use Kali to attack Metasploitable  
  - Detect attacks in IDS/IPS & SIEM  
- [ ] Create threat hunting queries in ELK/Wazuh  
- [ ] Test firewall segmentation by isolating VMs into separate VLANs

# ðŸš€ Future Add-ons
- [ ] Deploy Active Directory lab for authentication testing  
- [ ] Add Honeypot (Cowrie) to attract attacks  
- [ ] Automate lab deployment with Ansible/Terraform
- [ ] Utilizing OpenCTI
